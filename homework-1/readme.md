Problems:

1. [20 points] Determine whether the below systems are linear or non-linear.
    a. dy/dt + 2y(t) = f^2 (t)
    b. dy/dt + 3ty(t) = t^2 f(t)
2. [40 points]
    a. For the LTIC system with the below system equation, find the zero-
       input response (y 0 (t)) where the initial conditions are y 0 (0) = 2 and
       dy 0 (0) / dt = -1.

(D^2 +5D+6) y(t) = (D+1) f(t).

```
b. For the LTIC system with the unit impulse response of h(t) = e-t^ u(t).
Find the zero state response of the system y(t) if input is f(t) = u(t).
```
3. [40 points]
    a. Find the unit impulse response h[k] of the following system: y[k+1] +
       2y[k] = f[k].
    b. Determine the zero-state response of the LTID system with the unit
       impulse response of h[k] = (-2)k u[k] if the input f[k] = e-k u[k].
