Problems:

1. [ 4 0 points] Consider the following periodic signal x(t) shown below.

```
a. Find the compact trigonometric Fourier series and sketch the
amplitude and phase spectra.
b. Find the exponential Fourier series and sketch the corresponding
spectra.
```
2. [30 points] Consider the following LTIC system:

(D^2 +3D+2)y(t)=(D+3)f(t),

Find the zero-state response if the input f(t) is e-3tu(t) using Fourier
Transform.

3. [30 points] A TV signal (video and audio) has a bandwidth of 4.5 MHz. This
    signal is sampled, quantized, and binary-coded to obtain a PCM (pulse code
    modulated) signal.
       a. Determine the sampling rate if the signal is to be sampled at a rate
          20% above the Nyquist rate.
       b. Determine the number of binary pulses required to encode each
          sample if the quantization level is 1024.
       c. Determine the binary pulse rate (bits/second) of the binary coded
          signal.
